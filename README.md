# Lipo Power UPS

DC uninterruptible power supply specially designed for 3D printers. It can be used in both 24V and 12V systems. 
For the recovery battery use a high capacity LiPo or LiIon battery, 6S for 24V and 3S for 12V. High power 
diodes conmutate power from power supply or battery so printer will no turn off even when electrical lines 
goes down. System has an integrated power MOSFET and a voltage sensing circuit that will turn off power from 
battery if it goes down a warning voltage of 3.15V per cell, avoiding in this way a death battery.
